/// Super-Sampling is an antialiasing technique that increases
   // the Spatial quantization of the display's array by increasing
   // the number of data Samples that are taken at or around each
  //  pixel location corresponding to a portion of the image to be
  //  displayed, and then combining the resulting values of these
  //  multiple data Saa Samples to obtain a final display value for each
                      pixel location.
